---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Database connected successfully" but API returns 403
- Check if user has correct role
- Verify user is assigned to the project
- For members, check if they're the task assignee

### "Unauthorized" error
- JWT token expired → login again
- Check authToken cookie in browser DevTools
- Clear cookies and retry login

### MongoDB connection fails
- Verify MONGODB_URI in .env.local
- Check IP whitelist in MongoDB Atlas (allow all for dev)
- Ensure database user has correct credentials

### Admin signup says "Invalid invite key"
- Check ADMIN_SIGNUP_KEY in .env.local
- Make sure you typed it correctly
- Default is `admin123`
